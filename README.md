# Clustering
This repository is the clustering algorithms i have completed or am working on.
1) Clustering of Casacadia subduction zone earthquakes, then solely cascadia subduction zone earthquakes directly offshore Vancouver.

2) A workbook to classify mall shoppers based on their spending, was used to practice the method. K-means clustering was done to sort the different shoppers into clusters based off their spending. The Elbow method was used to determine the correct amount of clusters needed. I am currently implementing the same algorithms for analyzing earthquake data offshore Vancouver for my research. This is now included as 1.
