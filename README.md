# Clustering
This repository is the clustering algorithms i have completed or am working on.
The first, a workbook to classify mall shoppers based on their spending, was used to practice the method.
K-means clustering was done to sort the different shoppers into clusters based off their spending. The Elbow method was used to determine the correct amount of clusters needed.
I am currently implementing the same algorithms for analyzing earthquake data offshore Vancouver for my research. This will be included in my thesis so will not be posted until the thesis is complete.
